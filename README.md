# Cryptocurrency-Market-Data-Analysis-Blockchain-Application
This project fetches cryptocurrency market data using the CoinGecko API, performs technical analysis (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, Volatility), and visualizes the results with Python. The analyzed data is then stored on the Ethereum blockchain using a Solidity smart contract, ensuring secure and immutable data storage. The contract allows users to store and retrieve key market metrics for different cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner. Tools used include Python, Pandas, Web3.py, Solidity, and Ganache (for local blockchain testing).
